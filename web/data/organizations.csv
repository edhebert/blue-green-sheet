<p><strong>Riverbend Today</strong></p>
<p><span>Riverbend currently serves over 200 students, ages 15 months to 8th grade, and employs 55 staff members who come from over 30 towns. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Riverbend attracts families from over 20 Metrowest communities including Natick, Wellesley, Weston, Natick, Needham, Dover, and more. Our talented faculty are highly qualified &mdash; over 46% of faculty hold advanced degrees. And many of our toddler through elementary teachers have been trained through accredited programs and granted American Montessori Society (AMS) or Association of Montessori Internationale (AMI) teaching certificates.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Approximately 20% of the school&rsquo;s students and 25% of the school&rsquo;s staff identify as ethnically or racially non-white, and Riverbend provides financial assistance to 20% of its families, which is higher than the national average for independent schools. In addition to the regular school day, after-school enrichments and summer programs are offered to Riverbend students and the community at large. Riverbend also hosts free monthly adult learning sessions for Riverbend families and the greater MetroWest community. Additionally, Riverbend has thriving partnerships with many other groups and nonprofits with aligned missions and similar target demographics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Summer 2024, a generous bequest of property &ndash; including two homes and five acres of park-like gardens &ndash; allowed Riverbend to realize its 2018 Strategic Vision to &ldquo;become a beacon of Montessori excellence&rdquo; by establishing The Sheila and Frank Magullion Education and Retreat Center. The Center and its surrounding properties have significantly enhanced Riverbend&rsquo;s existing outdoor education programs and will soon provide a reflective space for symposia and events for educators. </span><span>Through the Center, Riverbend also will further its commitment to increasing equity and accessibility in teacher education by creating a Teacher Training Fellowship Program to directly serve individuals otherwise unable to access or afford training in the Montessori Method.</span></p>
<p><span>Riverbend is led by a Head of School who directly oversees a six-person senior administrative team that in turn manages 48 faculty and staff. The Head of School reports to the 21-member Board of Directors. The Board has an Executive Committee consisting of the Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, Treasurer and Governance Committee Chair, an active Governance Committee, and many other standing and ad hoc committees that meet monthly throughout the year.</span></p>","33 Eliot Street, Natick, MA, USA",Natick,Massachusetts,United States,1760,,,,

<p><span>At ASIJ, we believe that a school should be a safe, child-centered place where educators are idealistic about the potential of every student and tenacious in their support for each student as she learns, takes risks, makes mistakes, and grows. We believe that every student has the right to learn and that we have an obligation to know, value, and care for each child. We believe that creativity and independent thinking happen when students are highly engaged, especially when purposeful assessment drives learning and when goals are clear, focused, and personalized. We believe that students excel in a learning environment where they receive high quality feedback, opportunities for reflection, and a culture in which they frequently self-assess their own learning. We believe that students should learn through authentic experiences that challenge them to identify, understand, and solve complex multidisciplinary problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div data-item=""0"">
<p>Heathwood Hall is an Episcopal school. As such, we are charged with the educational and spiritual development of students of all faiths and backgrounds. While most of our students are Christian, we welcome students from all religions and cultural backgrounds and feel that our community is richer for that diversity.</p>
<p>Like all Episcopal schools, Heathwood integrates spiritual formation into students&rsquo; daily experience. All students and faculty gather for worship and prayer each week in the Chapel of the Epiphany. We use the Episcopal Church&rsquo;s Book of Common Prayer and honor all religious holidays. We seek unity through common prayer, not common doctrine. As an Episcopal community, we worship, learn, and serve together in the recognition that God is the center of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With God&rsquo;s help, Heathwood strives for justice and peace among all peoples, respects the dignity of every human being, embraces social responsibility and is devoted to good stewardship of the earth.&nbsp; Every subject at every level is taught in the context of a community of learners created in the image of God.</p>
<p>Through the habit of regular Chapel attendance, our students experience the rhythms of corporate worship, the benefits of common prayer, and the value of spiritual reflection. It is our hope they become more able to grapple with life&rsquo;s meaning and value and to practice those lessons of mind and heart in the world.</p>
