560,"The Field School, Director of Technology","<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1972 and located on an outstanding campus in Washington, D.C., The Field School serves approximately 370 students in grades 6-12. Field provides students with an inquiry-based curriculum encompassing organized &ldquo;fields&rsquo;&rsquo; of knowledge taught in an environment that stresses dialogue, analytic thinking, and larger lessons of how young people can grow to become generous, responsible, and self-knowing adults. Field has also just begun its most ambitious capital project to-date, a $20M campus expansion project that includes new athletics facilities, campus meeting spaces and classrooms, and a 15,000-sq. ft. THINK Studio.</p>
<p>Field now seeks a director of technology to oversee all aspects of its technology program. The technology department is led by the director, includes a full-time IT specialist, and is supported by a D.C.-based MSP. The incoming director will lead ongoing improvements to the school&rsquo;s technology infrastructure as the campus expands, streamline systems and workflows, and consider innovative ways to manage institutional data and technologies. The current technology director will retire in 2026 and is flexible with the transition timeline, so Field is open to candidates who can start in early 2026 or closer to the summer. All that said, Field&rsquo;s priority is to have its next director of technology installed no later than the end of June 2026.</p>

546,The Bement School - Head of School,"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;We hold the door for each other.&rdquo; At The Bement School, this phrase is more than a gesture&mdash;it&rsquo;s a way of life. It reflects a community built on kindness, humility, and mutual respect, where every person is known and every voice matters. Founded in 1925, Bement is an independent coeducational day and boarding school serving children in kindergarten through grade 9, with boarding beginning in grade 3. Nestled between the Pocumtuck Range and the Deerfield River in the heart of Massachusetts&rsquo; Pioneer Valley, Bement is a joyful, close-knit community where curiosity is nurtured, hard work is celebrated, and happiness is part of the daily rhythm. Whether it&rsquo;s kindergartners chasing butterflies or ninth graders diving into science experiments, students at Bement are encouraged to embrace new experiences and grow into confident, compassionate learners.</p>
<p>Bement is a school of place and purpose. The historic Deerfield campus offers access to a rich cultural and natural landscape, while its international community infuses the school with global awareness and perspective. Students learn not only how to succeed in secondary school and beyond, but also how to engage thoughtfully with the world around them. With dedicated educators, a vibrant curriculum, and a commitment to whole-child development, Bement offers a truly exceptional educational experience grounded in tradition, lifted by innovation, and guided every day by the belief that we are strongest when we care for one another.</p>

<p><strong>The Program</strong></p>
<p>The program at The Bement School is intentionally designed to nurture intellectual curiosity, creativity, and character in students from kindergarten through grade 9. Grounded in a whole-child philosophy, Bement&rsquo;s curriculum balances academic rigor with joyful exploration, ensuring that students build strong foundational skills and develop confidence, resilience, and empathy while also preserving the wonder of childhood. Small class sizes and dedicated faculty create an environment where every child is seen, supported, and challenged to grow. From early literacy and numeracy to advanced writing, science, and humanities, the academic program evolves with each student&rsquo;s developmental stage. Daily arts, outdoor education, athletics, and global learning opportunities enrich the core curriculum. The school&rsquo;s emphasis on kindness, collaboration, and personal responsibility fosters a community where learning is both purposeful and deeply human. At Bement, students are well-prepared for the next step in their education and inspired to lead lives of meaning, service, and connection.</p>
<p><strong>Governance and Finance</strong></p>
<p>Bement&rsquo;s governance is marked by a strong, strategic, and mission-aligned Board of Trustees that partners closely with the Head of School to steward the institution with clarity, care, and foresight. The Board has embraced its role as a policy-setting body and key support to the Head's leadership in day-to-day operations, especially through periods of transition and growth. Trustees bring a deep commitment to Bement&rsquo;s long-term health and sustainability through their disciplined fiscal oversight, enthusiastic support of the Second Century Campaign, and engagement in strategic planning. As the school moves into a new chapter of leadership and embarks on transformative campus projects, the Board is focused on ensuring that financial decisions align with programmatic priorities and mission fidelity. Recognizing the importance of transparency, inclusivity, and trust, the Board is also working to strengthen channels for communication with the broader school community and deepen its own engagement with philanthropy and the evolving needs of Bement&rsquo;s students and educators.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>The Bement community is one of the school&rsquo;s most defining and enduring strengths&mdash;a warm, inclusive, and tightly knit environment where every child is seen, known, and celebrated. Rooted in a culture of kindness, respect, and shared responsibility, this spirit of connection radiates throughout the school from classrooms and dormitories to playing fields, family-style lunches, and all-school events like Spring Fling and regular opportunities for Upper School and Lower School buddies to connect. Faculty and staff go beyond academic instruction to build meaningful, personal relationships with students, creating a nurturing and home-like atmosphere, especially within the boarding program. Families feel welcomed and involved, thanks to Bement&rsquo;s multi-layered communication systems, inclusive event planning, and a vibrant parent association that fosters strong school-family partnerships.</p>
<p>This deep sense of belonging is not accidental. It is cultivated daily through intentional practices such as advisory programs, restorative approaches, and social-emotional learning frameworks, which guide both student development and community norms. At Bement, everyone contributes: faculty collaborate across roles, students lead with empathy and initiative, and trustees and administrators remain grounded in the values that animate daily life. As the school embarks on major capital improvements and continues its DEI work, the community&rsquo;s early philanthropic support and collective vision reflect the strength of this shared investment. The result is a place where students flourish academically, socially and emotionally, where they are prepared to lead with compassion, resilience, and a deep sense of responsibility to others.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty and Administration</strong></p>
<p>Bement&rsquo;s faculty and administration form the core of the school&rsquo;s excellence as a dynamic, mission-driven team deeply committed to nurturing the intellectual, emotional, and ethical development of every student. Faculty bring a blend of expertise, creativity, and compassion to their teaching, designing rich, engaging learning experiences that challenge students while honoring their individuality. Beyond the classroom, they serve as advisors, coaches, mentors, and dorm parents, building relationships that are personal, lasting, and grounded in care. Administrators are accessible, thoughtful, and collaborative, fostering a culture of shared purpose and partnership with faculty to uphold a cohesive, student-centered program.</p>
<p>As Bement moves into its second century, investing in faculty and staff wellbeing, leadership development, and professional learning is not only a strategic imperative&mdash;it is essential to sustaining the vibrancy, warmth, and excellence that define the Bement experience.</p>
<p><strong>Campus</strong></p>
<p>Bement&rsquo;s campus offers a picturesque and intimate setting that reflects the school&rsquo;s close-knit community and deep connection to place. With a mix of historic buildings, modern learning spaces, and Pine Hill, a 12-acre outdoor education center, the campus supports both academic and experiential learning for day and boarding students. While beloved for its charm and natural beauty, the campus faces limitations in space and facilities that the school is actively working to address. The upcoming construction of a new dining hall, library, recreation space, and K&ndash;2 classrooms will significantly enhance the campus&rsquo; functionality and foster greater community connection. These investments are designed to strengthen the daily experience of students, faculty, and families, and to ensure that Bement&rsquo;s physical environment matches the excellence of its program.</p>
<p><strong>Graduates</strong></p>
<p>Bement graduates emerge as confident, capable, and compassionate young people, well-prepared for the academic and personal challenges of secondary school and beyond. Rooted in a strong foundation of critical thinking, character development, and community-mindedness, they carry with them the habits, values, and resilience cultivated during their years at Bement. Bement alumni are known for their intellectual curiosity, leadership, and empathy, and these qualities set them apart in the classrooms, dormitories, and communities they join next. With high acceptance rates to top-choice secondary schools and a deep sense of self, Bement graduates leave ready to thrive and contribute meaningfully to the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities and Challenges for the Next Head of School</strong></p>
<p>The next Head of School will step into a vibrant, mission-driven community at a pivotal and promising moment. As Bement prepares to celebrate its centennial and launch into its second century, the school is thriving. Bement has strong enrollment, record-breaking philanthropy, an exceptional faculty and staff, and a deeply rooted culture of kindness, curiosity, and community. This transition offers a rare opportunity to build upon a solid foundation while leading with vision and innovation. The next Head will inherit an energized strategic plan, a high-functioning and supportive Board of Trustees, and early momentum toward a transformative campus expansion. The school&rsquo;s physical renewal is well underway, with over $8 million raised toward a $13 million capital campaign goal and pre-construction work already approved.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new Head will be called to lead through complexity with clarity, warmth, and purpose. Faculty and staff have voiced a desire for continued progress in areas such as workload equity, compensation transparency, and inclusive decision-making. Strengthening communication across all levels of the institution will be essential to maintaining trust, morale, and unity. The Head will have the opportunity to support and continue the school&rsquo;s efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and mission-aligned adult community. The ongoing work of curricular alignment between the Lower and Upper Schools, as well as clarity around Bement&rsquo;s academic identity, will require thoughtful leadership and cross-divisional collaboration.</p>
<p>Bement&rsquo;s culture of deep care and community is one of its greatest assets, and the next Head must nurture that strength and steward the school&rsquo;s evolving needs. Balancing tradition with innovation, embracing feedback while maintaining focus, and championing a student-centered vision while empowering adults will all be critical to success. With a committed Board, engaged families, and a dedicated faculty and staff, the next Head of School will find at Bement both the tools and the team to lead boldly and help shape the next 100 years of this remarkable school.</p>

Founded in 1945 as the first racially integrated school in Washington, D.C., GDS was established as a school where children from across the Washington area could learn together in diverse groups, be joyful in their learning, and aspire to have a meaningful impact locally, nationally, and globally. This founding vision remains at the heart of the School's identity and purpose today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next Head will inherit a thriving school shaped by a dedicated faculty and staff, engaged students and families, and a passionate alumni community. The School has a strong foundation and is well-positioned for the future, with a robust demand for admission and strong student retention, a recently completed AIMS accreditation (2024), a newly unified campus, and a strong financial position with a growing endowment. The current strategic plan, <a href=""https://www.gds.org/about/strategic-vision"">Audacious Beginnings, Bold Futures</a><a href=""https://www.gds.org/about/strategic-vision"">,</a> was completed in 2024 and outlines four guiding priorities for GDS&rsquo;s next chapter: (i) purposeful, joyful, and integrated education; (ii) thriving educators; (iii) equitable access and long-term sustainability; and (iv) innovation and reinvention.</p>

<p>GDS offers a rigorous, inquiry-based program led by 230 full-time educators with an average tenure of 15 years. Students experience small classes, extensive co-curricular opportunities, and an ethos that values self-reflection, respectful dialogue, high academic standards, and ethical leadership. With over 1,000 students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, GDS draws from all eight wards of D.C., as well as surrounding communities in Maryland and Virginia. The School&rsquo;s newly unified campus in Northwest Washington, D.C. fosters a joyful and inclusive learning environment that pairs academic excellence and rigor with social impact, empowering students to ask hard questions, solve complex problems, and lead with purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary opportunity for a visionary leader who believes in the power of progressive education and the limitless potential of young people and their ability to become leaders in a diverse and evolving society. The next Head will model empathy, integrity, and joy; build trust across a diverse and dynamic community; celebrate excellence and the sometimes messy (yet always essential) pursuit of it; and steward an institution that takes pride in its powerful legacy while embracing academic rigor, innovation, and forward progress. The Head will guide the School in strengthening cross-divisional collaboration; supporting and celebrating faculty and staff; ensuring high academic standards and achievement; advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives; and amplifying GDS&rsquo;s voice in a competitive local and national landscape. Most importantly, the Head will ensure that students remain the School&rsquo;s north star and that GDS cultivates a learning environment where academic excellence, personal growth, and community engagement are interwoven.</p>

In June of 2017, CHA was authorized as an International Baccalaureate School for the Primary Years Program (PYP). That was followed by the Middle Years Program (MYP) authorization in 2020 which made CHA the first school in the San Fernando Valley offering the IB program for students in Preschool through 8th grade. <strong>In the summer of 2020, CHA moved off of the Chatsworth campus to the campus of First Presbyterian in Granada Hills and became Granada Preparatory School.</strong></p>
<p>GPS combines the strengths of its founding schools, with a common vision that our students will be kind, creative, compassionate, life-long learners inspired to take shared guardianship of the planet and create a better world.

<p>Serving gifted students and their families from Pre-K to Grade 12, Tessellations (Tessie) provides an appropriately challenging experiential education that recognizes and nurtures the individual strengths of gifted learners, empowering them to confidently express who they are and pursue a meaningful life. Often when students start at Tessie, it is the first time they feel like they’re interacting with intellectual peers.  Whether discussing every airplane model that was ever built since the first flight or explaining to another student the concept of infinity, students greet each other’s interests with kindness and awe. Tessie teachers foster their students’ curiosity and are appropriately attuned to the corresponding sensitivities that some of these learners display. Exploration, openness, and a commitment to meet the developmental needs of all its students is what you’ll find at the heart of this new and still developing school.</p>
<p>Born out of the demand of Silicon Valley’s families, Tessie opened in 2020 through a collaboration between a group of like-minded families and educators. In just five years, Tessie has grown from serving 30 gifted learners online to almost 300 on a 9.4-acre main campus, as well as an additional local nature campus that provides easy access to the outdoor exploration—a key part of the project-based program. Tessie’s promise is to support gifted learners in their education and development so that these young people develop the mindset and skills to contribute to creative and innovative life-changing solutions.     </p>

519,"Sage Hill School, Director of College Counseling","<p><span>Sage Hill School seeks a strategic and collaborative leader to serve as its next Director of College Counseling. Since its founding in 2000, Sage Hill has experienced remarkable growth and success, rightfully earning a reputation as the leading independent school in Orange County. The next Director will succeed the 13-year-long leadership of their predecessor and will inherit a strong and stable team. The Director will also join Sage Hill at a critical and exciting moment, as the School prepares for the opening of a new Middle School in August 2026. As part of this expansion, the Director will serve as a visionary leader for Sage Hill’s college counseling strategy in a 7-12 environment. Sage Hill is relatively young and nimble, and that agility extends to a college counseling office unafraid to pivot, iterate, and test new approaches on the cutting edge of college counseling. This leader must resonate with that dual approach of high quality and high innovation, and a commitment to data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span>Sage Hill boasts a vibrant, 28-acre campus with inviting classrooms, wide-open spaces, and state-of-the-art athletics and arts facilities. At present, Sage Hill offers a dynamic, college-preparatory curriculum to its 600 students in grades 9-12, designed to inspire independence, creativity, and critical thinking skills. An average class size of 14 enables students to challenge themselves and nurture relationships with motivated peers and an excellent, dedicated faculty. Sage Hill plans to expand this successful approach to 7</span><span>th</span><span> and 8</span><span>th</span><span> grades, with a Middle School on the main campus that will be well integrated into the wider Sage Hill community. Like the Upper School, the Middle School will encourage students to foster a sense of independence; learn to accept responsibility; develop a love of learning; and use that knowledge creatively, compassionately, and courageously throughout one’s life.</span></p>
<p><span>As the only independent, non-denominational high school in Orange County, and soon to be the sole 7-12 independent school in the county, Sage Hill competes with well-regarded public and parochial schools, and it constantly reevaluates its value proposition and competitive advantage. Simultaneously, Sage Hill has enjoyed strong, stable leadership in its Head of School, enabling it to maintain steady enrollment numbers and a robust financial outlook. In the fall of 2023, the school launched the largest capital campaign in its history, with a goal of $25 million, for the construction of the Middle School. Only one year into the campaign, the school had successfully raised $18 million of that goal, evidencing the community’s support of the school and its ambitious goals.</span></p>
<p><span>The Director of College Counseling, reporting to the Assistant Head of School for Academics, will lead the continued evolution and articulation of the college counseling program. The successful candidate must demonstrate a strong commitment to Sage Hill’s mission and core values and will be a proven leader within the field of college counseling. Specifically, the incoming Director will shape and refine a college counseling strategy that includes grades 7 and 8; build strong relationships with students and families; partner with the broader Sage Hill community; serve as a voice in the national college counseling landscape; leverage the use of data analytics; and support and mentor a strong college counseling team.

The successful candidate will be tasked with upholding academic excellence while fostering a culture that values both community spirit and individual student development. The ideal applicant should possess a proven track record as an inspiring leader and adept fundraiser, with experience in aligning diverse stakeholders around a shared vision within complex institutional environments.</span><br /><br /><span>For over two centuries, Albany Academy has been a beacon of academic achievement, character development, and personal growth. It has rightfully earned its reputation as the Capital Region's premier – and sole – pre-K to post-graduate independent, college preparatory day school. The Academy's current structure, resulting from the merger of two single-sex schools, offers an innovative educational model. Students experience co-educational learning in the lower school (pre-K through grade 4) and upper school (grades 9 through post-graduate), while benefiting from single-sex education in the middle school (grades 5 through 8). The school's mission statement emphasizes the development of ""diligent students of high character who become curious, critical thinkers"" through a coordinated approach of single-sex and co-educational environments. The Academy's brand promise, ""exceptional beyond measure,"" reflects its unwavering commitment to cultivating excellence in every student, nurturing limitless potential through individualized guidance, rigorous academics, and diverse opportunities.</span><br /><br /><span>Situated on an urban campus in Albany, New York, the Academy is home to 78 faculty and staff members and 636 students as of the 2024-2025 academic year. The institution takes pride in honoring its rich history and traditions while evolving to meet the needs of contemporary students.</span><br /><br /><span>The incoming head of school will join the Academy at an exciting juncture, following a realignment that transitioned the lower and upper schools to fully co-educational learning while maintaining single-sex education in the middle school.

<p><span>6. Collaborate with the board of trustees to accomplish its goals and position the Academy for even greater achievements.</span><br /><br /><span>The anticipated salary range for this position is $300,000 - $350,000 annually.

<p><span>In Summer 2024, a generous bequest of property &ndash; including two homes and five acres of park-like gardens &ndash; allowed Riverbend to realize its 2018 Strategic Vision to &ldquo;become a beacon of Montessori excellence&rdquo; by establishing The Sheila and Frank Magullion Education and Retreat Center. The Center and its surrounding properties have significantly enhanced Riverbend&rsquo;s existing outdoor education programs and will soon provide a reflective space for symposia and events for educators. </span><span>Through the Center, Riverbend also will further its commitment to increasing equity and accessibility in teacher education by creating a Teacher Training Fellowship Program to directly serve individuals otherwise unable to access or afford training in the Montessori Method.</span></p>

509,"French International School of Oregon, Chief Financial Officer","<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As Portland&rsquo;s longest-established language immersion school and the only International Baccalaureate (IB) World School in Portland for preschool through eighth grade, French International School of Oregon educates students from a global perspective, preparing them to engage with inclusivity, achieve with integrity, and excel with distinction. French International has always been a school that embraces change and transformation in order to provide a unique experience for its students, and school leaders have spent the last 47 years developing and delivering an exceptional educational program. French International attracts the best educators from across the globe, who combine language immersion with the IB framework to nurture a global mindset, provide foundational skills for lifelong success, and enable children to navigate the world with empathy and curiosity. The past few years have been ones of marked growth and evolution for the school, with enrollment at an historical high and an exciting $8MM capital campaign already underway to modernize the school&rsquo;s campus.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, the business office and other operational departments have come to play an increasingly important role in budget management, plant construction and improvement, and daily logistics. French International is currently hiring for a chief financial officer (CFO) who will contribute to this momentum by providing exceptional leadership around financial analysis, operational efficiency, internal workflows, and strategic planning. The CFO oversees three functional units&mdash;finance, HR, and facilities. The point positions for the finance and HR units are both in transition, with a new role (controller) having just been created, and the director of HR position having just come open. Thus, the next CFO should be comfortable evaluating financial and HR processes, eager to assess and improve workflows, and excellent at staff development and team dynamics. All the while French International needs a skilled C-level leader who can plan, forecast, strategize, and develop outstanding partnerships with external stakeholders. The CFO is a member of the senior leadership team and reports directly to the head of school. French International is looking to onboard the next CFO this summer, to ensure a smooth start to the 2025-2026 school year.</p>

<p><strong>Purposeful Learning</strong></p>
<p>We work hard, think critically, and solve problems tenaciously. Learning should be intentional, engaging, and empowering.

<p><strong>Cultivating Character</strong></p>

<p>JTD is a uniquely enriching learning environment that prioritizes both academic rigor and character development. The school is recognized for its high-caliber education, strong co- teaching model, and commitment to cultivating character, fostering a truly special and caring community.</p>
<p>The Head of School is praised for her unwavering loyalty, empathy, and thoughtful leadership, creating a supportive and inclusive culture for both staff and students. Parents deeply appreciate the value of the school, rallying around their children and forming a tight knit, engaged community.</p>
<p>The school's environment is highly collegial, with hardworking, professional, and kind staff who collaborate closely, making the workplace enjoyable and fulfilling. The emphasis on &rdquo;The 5C&rsquo;s"" (Caring, Common Sense, Consideration, Cooperation, Courtesy) and character-driven education extends beyond students to faculty, fostering mutual respect and a commitment to good citizenship. A strong sense of attachment exists among colleagues, students, and families, reinforcing the feeling of belonging and stability. JTD also values initiative, recognizing and appreciating those who go above and beyond, further strengthening its team-oriented atmosphere.</p>
<p>With a nearly 100-year history, JTD is a stable institution with deep-rooted traditions and a strong sense of warmth. The joy of childhood is evident throughout the school, reflected in both students and staff. The school benefits from steady enrollment and a strong culture of philanthropy, allowing the Board to focus on strategic direction and impact rather than operational concerns. Overall, JTD is seen as a special, family-like community that blends tradition, excellence, and a nurturing environment for both students and educators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>JTD stands at a pivotal moment as it embarks on a transformative capital campaign and construction project. To support this bold vision, the school seeks its first Director of Operations (DOO) to drive operational excellence and sustainability. This role will empower the Head of School to focus on strategic leadership while ensuring the school&rsquo;s daily operations, HR, and campus projects run efficiently.</p>
<p>The DOO will oversee operational functions, logistics, and facilities, aligning strategies with JTD&rsquo;s mission. As a key member of the Administrative Team, they will collaborate with the Board of Trustees, manage the Facilities Department, and lead Human Resources, fostering a thriving workplace culture and compliance with evolving labor laws. The DOO will be a strategic thought partner to the IT Manager and Community Programs Manager, collaborating to develop and implement effective strategies that positively impact the JTD community.</p>
<p>A primary responsibility will be overseeing JTD&rsquo;s multi-year construction project&mdash;ensuring timelines, budgets, and stakeholder communication remain on track. Additionally, the DOO will manage security, emergency preparedness, and campus maintenance, ensuring a safe and inspiring learning environment.</p>
<p>The DOO will work closely with the Head of School, Division Heads, Director of Teaching &amp; Learning, and the Director of Finance to implement recommendations emerging from a multi-year project to enhance faculty compensation, benefits, and the evaluation system. As the point person for employee relations, the Head of School will rely heavily on the DOO&rsquo;s expertise to support JTD&rsquo;s strategic goal of retaining excellent educators.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate is a strategic problem-solver who excels in innovation, collaboration, and execution. While experience in independent schools or construction is a plus, the priority is a commitment to operational excellence and long-term sustainability. They should also have the flexibility to work evenings and weekends as needed.</p>
<p>This is more than an operations role&mdash;it&rsquo;s a rare opportunity to shape JTD&rsquo;s future, strengthening its foundation for generations to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Candidate Profile</strong></p>
<p>The ideal candidate will have the following professional and personal qualities, skills, and characteristics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Operational and Strategic Leadership</strong></p>
<p>A leader who can seamlessly oversee the daily operations of the school, ensuring that all aspects&mdash;from facilities management to security&mdash;are well-coordinated and efficient. A data-driven approach is essential to identifying inefficiencies and implementing improvements that optimize the school&rsquo;s operations. Beyond handling logistics, this individual will be a strategic thinker and must also think of the school as a business, ensuring that decisions are made with long-term financial and operational sustainability in mind. Their leadership will alleviate operational burdens, allowing the Head of School to focus on strategic priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project and Facilities Management</strong></p>
<p>Managing capital projects, particularly large-scale construction, will be a major aspect of this role. The leader must be highly organized and detail-oriented, ensuring that all phases of construction are executed on schedule and within budget. Acting as the day-to-day project lead, the leader will coordinate with the Owner&rsquo;s Rep, Director of Finance (DFO), and contractors while keeping the Board and school community informed. Additionally, they will oversee ongoing facilities management, security, fire mitigation, and emergency preparedness, ensuring that the school remains a safe and well-maintained environment. Their ability to juggle long-term construction projects while also handling daily operational responsibilities will be critical in ensuring the smooth functioning of the school&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HR and People Management</strong></p>
<p>This position will oversee key HR functions, including employee relations, conflict resolution, and benefits administration. The ideal candidate has deep expertise in Human Resources Management and a strong understanding of California labor law and employment practices. They will provide expert guidance to ensure compliance while fostering a supportive workplace culture. Serving as the primary HR resource for faculty and staff, they will ensure continuity in HR services and handle employee concerns professionally and equitably. Strong listening skills, empathy, and the ability to address challenges with fairness and clarity are essential. Additionally, they must understand the unique dynamics of an elementary school environment, where emotions and interpersonal relationships influence decision-making. By fostering a strong, supportive HR presence, they will enhance faculty and staff satisfaction and stability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adaptability, Problem-Solving, and Hands-On Leadership</strong></p>
<p>This role requires a proactive, hands-on leader who thrives in a dynamic school environment. A strategic problem-solver, they will anticipate challenges, implement solutions, and align operations with the school&rsquo;s long-term vision. With strong decision-making skills, they will manage HR, operations, and construction projects independently.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate must exercise independent judgment, discretion, and adaptability, maintaining flexibility to shift priorities as needed. Given the fast-paced nature of the school, they should be able to multi-task effectively, handling frequent interruptions while ensuring smooth operations. They should step into various roles as needed, ensuring smooth operations while fostering a collaborative, team-oriented culture. Resilient and adaptable, this leader will navigate the evolving complexities of independent school operations while maintaining a sense of urgency and accountability in all aspects of their work. With a resourceful and strategic mindset, they will balance immediate operational needs with long-term planning, ensuring the school&rsquo;s sustained success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strong Communication and Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Effective communication is critical for success in this role, as it involves working closely with various stakeholders, including the Board, project managers, facilities staff, neighborhood associations, and employees. The leader must excel in verbal and written communication, providing clear, structured, and timely updates on construction and operations. They will serve as the key liaison between project teams and the school community, ensuring that disruptions are well-communicated and managed proactively. Approachable and diplomatic, they will foster collaboration, ensuring faculty, staff, and external partners feel heard and informed. A high-touch communication approach is essential in this close-knit community, where transparency and engagement are highly valued.</p>

505,"Francis Parker School, Director of Instructional Technology and Information Systems","<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In the heart of San Diego is a nationally acclaimed independent school brimming with energy, determination, and vision. Each day, over 1,300 students from JK through grade 12, along with hundreds of faculty and staff, arrive at one of the two outstanding and iconic campuses of Francis Parker School, which was founded in 1912. The historic Mission Hills Campus houses the lower school division, while the recently remodeled Linda Vista Campus contains the middle and upper school divisions that feature some amazing new facilities.</p>
<p>The director of instructional technology and information systems reports to the assistant head of school for JK-12 strategic initiatives.&nbsp; The director serves as an active and full member of the Parker Leadership Team, which currently is a twelve-person body of school-wide administrators led by the head of school.&nbsp; The technology department has eight members: the director of instructional technology and information systems, whose purview and responsibility includes all aspects of technology, and seven dedicated professionals with specific areas of focus, all of whom report to the director. The next director can rest assured that the department already has an excellent plan in place for this summer, so that technology infrastructure, hardware, and systems will be ready for opening days. Parker would ideally welcome its next technology director on or around July 1, but school leaders will be pragmatic and patient if an out-of-town relocation requires a slightly later start date. If this opportunity speaks to you, Parker encourages you to submit your application materials by the April 20 priority deadline.</p>

We believe that students should learn through authentic experiences that challenge them to identify, understand, and solve complex multidisciplinary problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

493,"The Winsor School, Director of Technology","<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In the heart of Boston, less than a mile from Fenway Park, is an outstanding independent school that has been educating girls for nearly 140 years. The leader in girls&rsquo; education in Boston since 1886, The Winsor School has a rich history and an important mission: to prepare young women to pursue their aspirations and contribute to the world. Winsor is a vibrant community of students, teachers, families and staff who value intellectual curiosity, authentic engagement and personal integrity. Winsor challenges its 475 students in grades 5 through 12 to lead lives of purpose as responsible, generous-minded women. The school boasts a spectacular indoor/outdoor campus with modern facilities, an enviable location, and a national reputation for academic excellence, top-notch arts and athletics programs, and a commitment to belonging, support, and personal growth.</p>
<p>This summer, Winsor will welcome a new director of technology to oversee a mission-critical department that includes three other full-time dedicated professionals. At Winsor, the Technology Department plays an essential role in all aspects of school operations: supporting technology integration into classes and other co-curricular programs; deploying and maintaining a suite of enterprise database systems, and managing the critical IT infrastructure. The current director of technology oversaw a nearly complete rebuild of the backend infrastructure. At the same time, he and the department have built authentic, personal relationships with faculty, staff, and administrators. Thus, when the new director takes the helm this July, the next chapter of technology at Winsor will have a solid foundation from which to build and grow.</p>
<p>While Winsor has invested heavily in its technology program to ensure that students and teachers have access to state-of-the-art tools, hardware, and software, the school prioritizes human interaction, student engagement, and faculty/student relationships. Thus, the right next director will appreciate the importance of letting teachers find the right balance of technology usage&mdash;while still helping the leadership team and others to research and investigate emerging opportunities. On that note: Winsor has a robust STEM program in the Lower School, much of which runs through the school&rsquo;s Innovation lab. While this academic department does not report up to the director of technology, all members of the technology team are essential partners to the success of this applied technology program. The next director&rsquo;s arrival will coincide with the installation of Winsor&rsquo;s next head of school. In December, the current associate director of technology, who functions primarily on the network and systems side of the house, will step down after 10 years at Winsor to pursue new opportunities. The timing of this transition will ensure a seamless onboarding experience for the director of technology, and give the director an opportunity to evaluate the departmental structure and make a key internal hire. To further ensure a smooth opening to the school year, Winsor would like the next director to start on or before July 1&mdash;so that there is no gap in departmental leadership with the outgoing director. The director of technology reports directly to the head of school and is a member of the senior leadership team.</p>

487,"Mirman School, Director of Innovation and Technology","<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located 20 miles north of LAX in the Santa Monica Mountains, Mirman School is a K-8 independent school dedicated to serving highly gifted learners. With a mission to cultivate the boundless potential of its students, Mirman provides a challenging and enriching academic environment that fosters intellectual curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. The school emphasizes a holistic approach to education, balancing rigorous academics with social-emotional learning, character development, and opportunities for hands-on, project- based exploration. Mirman&rsquo;s curriculum is designed to meet the unique needs of highly gifted students, encouraging them to take intellectual risks, pursue their passions, and develop the skills necessary to become lifelong learners and leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology and innovation are integral to the Mirman experience, with a significant emphasis on STEM, design thinking, and interdisciplinary learning. The school&rsquo;s recently constructed Innovation Space serves as a hub for robotics, coding, engineering, and creative problem-solving. Mirman also prioritizes community, inclusion, and belonging, striving to create a community where students, faculty, and families feel valued and supported. With a collaborative and forward-thinking faculty, Mirman continually evolves to provide an exceptional educational experience that prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mirman School seeks a dynamic and strategic leader to serve as the director of innovation and technology, a new role that will oversee all aspects of educational technology, data/systems, IT infrastructure, and innovation to ensure the school remains at the forefront of digital learning for highly gifted students. Reporting to the head of school, the director will lead technology integration, professional development, and strategic initiatives while playing a key role in faculty support and the continued evolution of the school&rsquo;s newly constructed Innovation Space. This role requires a visionary leader who is also a hands-on technology professional that thrives in a fast-paced environment. The director should be eager to engage with students and faculty and committed to advancing Mirman&rsquo;s mission through the innovative and strategic use of technology. The director will oversee two IT support roles, one of which is open&mdash;thus giving the director a chance to make an early departmental hire. The school also works with an excellent local managed services provider on a time-and-materials basis to provide occasional higher-level engineering, project, and IT support. Mirman is eager for the new director to start early summer but no later than July 1, so that partnerships and connections with faculty and staff can be in place well before the start of the next school year.</p>

485,"Director of Finance and Operations, Turning Point School","<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Since 1970, Turning Point has been graduating students who are confident in their abilities, masterful in their achievements, and empathic in their worldview. Located in Culver City, CA, Turning Point serves approximately 300 students in preschool through 8th grade. The school&rsquo;s &ldquo;positive equation for achievement&rdquo; is based on scientific research and positive psychology, and encompasses the intellectual, social, physical, ethical, and emotional elements that drive each student&rsquo;s experience and growth from the very first day of preschool until eighth grade graduation. The school is committed to a program that produces talented, capable students who are not only ready to take on the challenges of high school, but are proud to have already made the world a better place.</p>
<p>As a member of the senior leadership team, the director of finance and operations (DFO) oversees the school&rsquo;s financial management, in addition to key operational areas: facilities, human resources, security and safety, and information technology. The DFO supervises two positions in the business office (a controller and an HR manager, the latter of which is currently unfilled), and facilities. The DFO partners closely with other senior administrators across multiple divisions and departments, including: academic, admissions, development, and DEI. An ideal candidate is someone who can provide day-to-day, hands-on leadership for finance and operations, but still offer strategic guidance to the head of school, senior leadership team, and board of trustees on long-term financial strategy. Culver City is a vibrant and rapidly transforming part of Los Angeles that offers many opportunities for growth, yet it is also a highly competitive market that requires creative approaches to resource management and financial planning. The DFO reports directly to the head of school and will be warmly welcomed to the community in the late spring or early summer.</p>

482,"Tessellations School, Middle School Director","<p><strong>Background</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Serving gifted students and their families from Pre-K to Grade 12, Tessellations (Tessie) provides an appropriately challenging experiential education that recognizes and nurtures the individual strengths of gifted learners, empowering them to confidently express who they are and pursue a meaningful life. Often, when students start at Tessie, it is the first time they feel like they belong and are interacting with intellectual peers.  Whether discussing every airplane model that was ever built since the first flight or explaining to another student the concept of infinity, students greet each other’s interests with enthusiasm, kindness, and awe. Tessie teachers foster their students’ curiosity and are appropriately attuned to the corresponding sensitivities that some of these learners display. Exploration, openness, and a commitment to meet the developmental needs of all its students are what you’ll find at the heart of this new and still developing school.</span></p>
<p><span>Born out of the demand of Silicon Valley’s families, Tessie opened in 2020 through a collaboration between a group of like-minded families and educators. In just five years, Tessie has grown from serving 30 gifted learners online to almost 300 on a 9.4-acre main campus, as well as an additional local nature campus that provides easy access to the outdoor exploration—a key part of the project-based program. Tessie’s promise is to support gifted learners in their education and development so that these young people develop the mindset and skills to contribute to creative and innovative life-changing solutions.                                              </span></p>

481,"Tessellations School, Elementary School Director","<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Serving gifted students and their families from Pre-K to Grade 12, Tessellations (Tessie) provides an appropriately challenging experiential education that recognizes and nurtures the individual strengths of gifted learners, empowering them to confidently express who they are and pursue a meaningful life. Often, when students start at Tessie, it is the first time they feel like they belong and are interacting with intellectual peers. Whether discussing every airplane model that was ever built since the first flight or explaining to another student the concept of infinity, students greet each other’s interests with enthusiasm, kindness, and awe. Tessie teachers foster their students’ curiosity and are appropriately attuned to the corresponding sensitivities that some of these learners display. Exploration, openness, and a commitment to meet the holistic needs of all its students are what you’ll find at the heart of this new and still developing school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Born out of the demand of Silicon Valley’s families, Tessie opened in 2020 through a collaboration between a group of like-minded families and educators. In just five years, Tessie has grown from serving 30 gifted learners online to almost 300 on a 9.4-acre main campus, as well as an additional local nature campus that provides easy access to the outdoor exploration—a key part of the project-based program. Tessie’s promise is to support gifted learners in their education and development so that these young people develop the mindset and skills to contribute to creative and innovative life-changing solutions.</p>

476,"Brandeis Marin, Head of School","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Brandeis Marin (Brandeis) is an independent, co-educational Jewish day school that serves K-8 students and their families in San Rafael, California. This community-oriented school reflects the diversity of the Marin Jewish population as well as the varied religious, cultural, and socio-economic tapestry of the Bay Area.</p>
<p>In 2015, after 37 years of being Brandeis Hillel Day School along with a sister school in San Francisco, the school separated to become Brandeis Marin, the first and only independent Jewish day school in Marin County. In the past decade, Brandeis has proved itself as a standalone and standout school with stellar academics, steeped in what matters and focused on building learners who will be productive citizens of our community and our world.</p>
<p>The school is known for its warm, welcoming, and inclusive environment where students are supported and empowered, and students and their families feel a strong sense of belonging and community.</p>

<p>On the Web: Brandeis Marin School (https://www.brandeismarin.org/ )</p>
<p><strong>The Program</strong></p>
<p>Brandeis&rsquo; program consists of an innovative, rigorous, and project-based curriculum infused with spiritual exploration and discovery. Students examine creek beds, build 3D models, and ponder the ins and outs of invertebrates. They plunge into equations, deconstruct complex texts, play an array of instruments (even ukulele!), and give back through service learning all while immersed in Jewish history and values. The curriculum is a values-based education program that provides individualized and project-based learning that serves diverse learning needs. The school has highly trained and dedicated teachers with a strong school-home partnership. In this day and age of teacher turnover, Brandeis faculty have an impressive average tenure of 19 years. All around the school, pride in Jewish identity and a connection to Israel is palpable, a remarkable quality given the diversity of Jewish practices within the Brandeis community.</p>
<p>The curriculum is based in Jewish values, holistically well-rounded, and tailored to diverse learning needs. Notably, Hebrew and Jewish Studies are taken seriously by everyone regardless of their Jewish practice or whether they are Jewish at all. Across K-8, studies are project-based, experiential, meaningful, compelling, and standards-aligned. The performing and visual arts are top-notch, with truly impressive programs not just for a small school; they are remarkably high-level, which serves as yet another attraction to this community. Additionally, the language program, student council, tzedakah project and mathletes are signature strengths of the school. Students especially love the 8th grade seminar-style class with the Head of School and the annual trip to Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Governance and Finance</strong></p>
<p>In terms of governance, you likely cannot find a better situation, as the board is described as &ldquo;the best board ever!&rdquo; by the current Head of School. This board deeply understands the role of governance and has a deep respect for the lay-professional partnership. The Board is strategic, forward-thinking, and dedicated to upholding the school&rsquo;s mission and setting up the school for long-term success. Initially, the board&rsquo;s priority was launching the school as an independent entity. Now, given its strong position, the board is looking forward and focused on ensuring the school is thriving long into the future and setting the tone as a premier Jewish day school in Northern California. In their estimation, Brandeis can and should be the first-choice education for all families looking for a Jewish-infused, best-in-class, progressive academic K-8 school. The school has no debt and a strong fundraising record (greater than $1 million/year) both of which are signs of its financial stability. They also exhibit commitment to Brandeis&rsquo; socioeconomic diversity, with a strong tuition assistance program and allotment.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>The school exudes a community feel at every turn. Despite not-insignificant tuition, there is a down-to-earth feel around campus, with zero efforts placed toward exerting status. Regardless of a family&rsquo;s means, Brandeis serves as a home to all of its families. This fosters a palpable, &ldquo;roll-up your sleeves&rdquo; modus operandi, with each staff and community member doing their utmost to make it all come together. Teamwork is the overwhelming principle across stakeholders. There is a focus on social issues and important Jewish community-building throughout the school&rsquo;s academic year. Tefillah happens every Thursday morning; many classrooms include Shabbat celebrations; and annually, the Purim Carnival, Yom Ha&rsquo;atzmaut (Israel Independence Day), and Tzedakah projects more broadly bring the community together.</p>
<p>Notably, all levels of Jewish observance and non-Jewish families alike are not only welcome at the school&mdash;they feel a sense of belonging. That sense of inclusivity goes beyond religion, as Brandeis accepts and supports a significant number of students with learning differences without being a targeted LD school. They maintain small class sizes (student-teacher ratio 5:1), and their administrators guide the instruction, differentiation, and individual support for the teachers. Overall, Brandeis is a place where students are free to be who they are, as tolerance and understanding are hallmarks of the school.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty and Administration</strong></p>
<p>You need only look at the faculty and staff at Brandeis to understand how strong the school is. The leadership team has been committed and steady at the wheel through the challenging times that Covid presented. The faculty are also committed, kind, and caring, and they uphold a rigorous curriculum without the school becoming a high-pressure environment for students. Indicative of the community, the average faculty tenure is almost 20 years! In an hour-long conversation with a class full of middle schoolers, the students filled the time with praising their teachers and their impact, and the way students feel seen, heard, and supported by them and the administration overall. The teachers have strong relationships with the parents and view their connection as a trusted partnership. As one teacher succinctly described, &ldquo;I feel trusted, protected and have grown as a professional here, it is my dream job. I love it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Campus</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the school is its unique position as part of an impressive community campus, nestled in the natural beauty of Marin&rsquo;s hillsides and a short drive from San Francisco. The campus includes Congregation Rodef Sholom, which just underwent a 2-year multimillion-dollar renovation to stunning effect, and the Osher Marin Jewish Community Center, with extensive facilities, including an indoor and outdoor pool&mdash;creating a one-of-a-kind hub for Jewish life. It&rsquo;s easy to see why the school fosters a sense of home for the whole family, as young children can attend preschool at the JCC; children of all ages can spend their summers at the JCC camp; many families worship, celebrate, mourn, and build community at the shul; the whole family can work out at the JCC; and school-age students can attend Brandeis. Everything a family would need is on this campus, and the school can access all of the campus facilities for their programming needs.</p>
<p><strong>Graduates</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;We cultivate leaders here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notably, Brandeis graduates are thoughtful, motivated, well-spoken young people of integrity. They go on to receive admission offers from their high schools of choice with a typical 95% acceptance rate. Their alums stand out as leaders in their new communities, even many years later. Brandeis prides itself on providing all graduates an unmatched preparedness for the world academically, emotionally, and spiritually that sets students up for success. Perhaps most importantly, the students who graduate are kind people and good citizens. The community remains proud of who they are in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities and Challenges for the Next Head of School</strong></p>
<p>Brandeis is financially stable with current enrollment at 140 and yet the school has the opportunity to grow to accommodate just over 200 students on campus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brandeis has higher enrollment in their upper grades as parents begin to recognize the benefits of a Brandeis education versus surrounding public and private schools, but small school size continues to be a barrier for some families, especially those that want a larger social peer group. Despite a very generous financial aid program, high tuition can also be a hindrance. There is support from the board, senior leadership team, and families to grow enrollment and the new head will have an opportunity to help craft that vision for growth.</p>
<p>Brandeis is committed to serving a diverse set of learners with an exceptional academic experience. This commitment creates some unique challenges for the school which they have addressed through small class sizes, differentiated instruction and a project-based curriculum. The new head will need to address ways to continue to grow while meeting the needs of diverse learners.</p>
<p>The shared areas of the campus have recently gone through a major renovation including the building of a beautiful modern new synagogue facing outwards to the Northern California foothills and re-landscaping of the surrounding open spaces shared with the Brandeis school community.&nbsp; This is a major plus for the school, and now the interior of the Brandeis facilities needs to be updated next. The Brandeis board is currently considering a capital campaign that would largely be in place for the new head to implement. A leader who is excited by this project and has project management experience will be a plus. With three organizations on one campus, the HOS will participate in constructive negotiations around use-of-space to the betterment of all three organizations, which takes patience, compromise, and creativity. Lastly, while the campus creates the opportunity for an all-in-one-place approach to Jewish family life, there are further opportunities to grow engagement via these shared spaces. The three organizations had a notably strong collaboration around the Purim Carnival, and that could be a model for the next head for future productive family programs.</p>
<p>From its inception, the curriculum at Brandeis Marin has been intentionally spiraled and systematically approached from kindergarten through 8th grade. There are codified curriculum maps to serve as living documents that outline the trajectory of a Brandeis Marin student&rsquo;s learning experience. The next head will collaborate with the Assistant Head of School to determine what curricular updates are warranted, examine differentiation within classes and ensure vertical alignment across all grades and subjects. Directing the right cadence and transparency in communications from administration and teachers to parents and within the school community will be part of the key relationship-building for the next Head of School.</p>
<p>Technology is also thoughtfully woven into the school culture and classes at Brandeis Marin.</p>
<p>The school prides itself on offering a quality, cutting edge technology program delivered by engaging instructors. Some parents have asked for more technology including coding, robotics, and artificial intelligence and the new head will need to collaborate with the school&rsquo;s experienced Chief Information &amp; Innovation Officer to evaluate the right balance of technology use and the technology infrastructure needs of the school.</p>

475,"Keys School, Associate Head of School for Curriculum, Community, and Culture","<p>Keys School, a K-8 independent school in the heart of Silicon Valley, is seeking an empathetic, strategic, and dynamic leader to serve as its inaugural Associate Head of School for Curriculum, Community, and Culture (AHCCC). Known for its warm and inclusive community, Keys School places a premium on academic excellence, social-emotional learning (SEL), and deep relationships. With a mission to challenge students to develop a keen intellect and a generous spirit, to advocate for themselves and others, and to honor curiosity and reflection in an increasingly hurried world, Keys has cultivated a distinctive environment where students are deeply known, valued, and empowered to thrive. This exciting new role reflects Keys&rsquo; continued commitment to integrating equity, belonging, and innovation into the core of its already strong curriculum, emotional intelligence practice, and grounded, authentic culture.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Head of School, Heather Rogers, the Associate Head will play a pivotal role in shaping the educational and cultural journey of students from kindergarten through 8th grade.

By fostering connection and cohesion across divisions, the AHCCC will uphold the school's mission and help guide its community in addressing both challenges and opportunities with grace and creativity.</p>
<p>Central to the success of this role will be the AHCCC's partnership with the Heads of Lower and Middle Schools, two highly respected and experienced leaders. Together, this trio will form the cornerstone of the school's academic leadership team, working in close collaboration to align and elevate curriculum, culture, and community. Their dynamic partnership will ensure that students and families experience a unified and intentional approach to the K-8 journey. Building upon Keys' established strengths in curriculum and instruction, the AHCCC will work closely with faculty and staff to recognize and amplify their expertise and creativity. By leveraging their complementary expertise, this team will set a powerful example of collaborative leadership, modeling the importance of connection, trust, and shared vision.</p>
<p>This inaugural role represents an opportunity to partner with a talented and dedicated team in advancing a school culture deeply rooted in joy, inclusion, and a love for learning. The AHCCC will join a community where kindness and advocacy are central to the student experience, where learning is relational, not transactional, and where the continuity of the Keys model fosters a close-knit and impactful environment for students and families alike.

Often when students start at Tessie, it is the first time they feel like they&rsquo;re interacting with intellectual peers. &nbsp;Whether discussing every airplane model that was ever built since the first flight or explaining to another student the concept of infinity, students greet each other&rsquo;s interests with kindness and awe. Tessie teachers foster their students&rsquo; curiosity and are appropriately attuned to the corresponding sensitivities that some of these learners display. Exploration, openness, and a commitment to meet the developmental needs of all its students is what you&rsquo;ll find at the heart of this new and still developing school.</p>
<p>Born out of the demand of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s families, Tessie opened in 2020 through a&nbsp;<br>collaboration between a group of like-minded families and educators. In just four years, Tessie has grown from serving 30 gifted learners online to almost 300 on a 9.4-acre main campus, as well as an additional local nature campus that provides easy access to the outdoor exploration&mdash;a key part of the project-based program.

<p><strong>Governance and Administration</strong></p>
<p>Tessellations currently has a nine-person Board of Directors.&nbsp; To bring a school from an idea to a fully functional PreK-Grade 12 school (currently serving students in 9th grade only) requires the dedication and commitment of each board member, and each board member is incredibly invested in the long-term success of the school. The board is made up of a collaborative group that understands the need to now transition from supporting all of the start-up operations to a group focused on long-term fiscal sustainability and viability. The board is actively expanding to ensure that they have the full range of needed expertise as well as to make sure that they are right-sized for the much bigger school they are today. To note, they have recently added two new board members: one an experienced administrator in a gifted school and the other an experienced independent school board member and fundraiser. In all ways, the board is invested in growing their learning and capacity, including working with an outside governance expert to make sure their work is both appropriate and at the highest level.</p>
<p>The founding Head of School and Executive Director Grace Stanat was the right individual to build and grow Tessie at the appropriate rate for durable success. The school is now ready for the next stage of leadership. The board has placed an Acting Head of School at the helm as they look for a system-oriented and experienced Head to guide the future of the school. The goal is to evolve the school from start-up mode to a more mature, yet still innovative institution. The right policies and protocols are needed to support the vision of a fully operational four-division school, serving over 300 students from preschool to grade 12. Driven by parent generosity in support of Tessie&rsquo;s story, the school&rsquo;s first five years have been marked by consistent fundraising success. Additionally, the school&rsquo;s marketing and external online presence has been polished and professional, especially for a school so early in its development.</p>
<p><strong>The Program</strong></p>
<p>At its core, Tessie is designed to serve gifted kids well and meet their needs at a high level. Progressive education principles guide all decisions around Tessie&rsquo;s program. The resulting curriculum is student centered, project-based, experiential, and innovative. As the school moves into a more established mode, additional work is needed to make sure the curriculum is in equal parts appropriately challenging and sufficiently skill-building for its students at each age and stage. Tessie has done an especially good job developing strong socioemotional programming throughout the curriculum. The student body shows up as kind, curious, all-in students who exhibit humility and lack the peer-to-peer competition or one-upmanship that can be prevalent in highly academic communities.</p>
<p>In the preschool, the curriculum is play-based, following best practices to foster empathy, collaboration, communication skills, and a love of learning. From the Lower School upwards, project-based learning with an emphasis on social justice and outdoor education is a throughline. Notably, Tessie is designed with differentiated education, including math and literacy groupings by ability rather than grade. Top-notch music, fine arts, drama, math enrichment, and debate programs bolster the core academic areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tessie&rsquo;s high school just opened this year and is still very much evolving. Opening a brand-new high school avoids the problems of wrestling with tradition. Thus, Tessellations High School is already being heralded nationally as a progressive school to watch. Having attracted an impressive group of founding faculty, the approach to curriculum is even more progressive than in K-8, with the school leaning fully into Competency-Based Learning, Mastery Transcripts, and the findings of ChallengeSuccess (a Stanford-based research group dedicated to improving the well-being of high school students). The inaugural 9th grade class only numbers 7 and will expand yearly until an eventual enrollment of approximately 300.</p>
<p>As Tessie matures, the administration will need to delicately balance teacher autonomy and empowerment while ensuring the quality control needed at a highly successful school. A positive culture of collaboration exists between faculty within grades and often divisions, yet work still remains for the same cooperation and knowledge to exist across divisions and programs to ensure alignment and appropriate progression of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Tessie represents a brilliant idea that still needs bolstering to actualize its promise of what is possible with its gifted and open students and its invested and dedicated parent body. The nature campus, the semiannual family camping trips, and the academic and enrichment programs need to be developed and systematized so that the nascent potential of Tessie can be realized.</p>
<p>Gifted students tend to have gifted parents, resulting in a community of fully invested, highly engaged caregivers, many of whom are high-achieving and highly successful in their fields. By and large, the parent body is a down-to-earth group that avoids social competitiveness and status symbols to create an environment inclusive for all. They tend to be supportive of the school and invested in its success. As the school has grown quickly, of late, there are a few more vocal concerns around greater classroom consistency, more transparent and timely communications, and greater stability with faculty and staff.</p>
<p>A strong admissions process that identifies, admits, and supports kids who need Tessie and whose needs Tessie can meet continues to be a hallmark of the school. One part of the admissions process involves evaluating and identifying students as gifted through a Gifted Qualitative Analysis (GQA) process based on the methods of Annemarie Roeper, a pioneer in gifted education. While incredibly effective, examining whether the full scope of the labor-intensive process is sustainable or can be streamlined remains an open question.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities and Challenges for the Next Head of School</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the high demand for strong progressive gifted education in Silicon Valley, the school has grown tremendously over its first five years. While growth is the first stage for long-term success of a start-up school, even more important is how a new school transitions to its next stage of development. The key transition pieces are multi-layered and the board has placed an Acting Head of School to aid in the transition. The Acting Head will start the process of setting up the systems, policies, and organizational structure needed for sustainable success. Part of this work will involve examining the 16+ directors and program leaders and ensuring that the leaders and programs are appropriately distributed and defined. Similarly, in the development stage, both parents and board members have contributed greatly to Tessie&rsquo;s programs and departments. The Acting Head will help with a reevaluation of appropriate roles and boundaries.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devoting the time to determine a communications strategy will be vital, as the Head determines the appropriate cadence, transparency, and tone of the school&rsquo;s messaging. The Head should think about exuding professionalism, reassurance, connection, and deep knowledge of the school and programs.</p>
<p>The admissions process at Tessie is already highly developed and honed, and the hiring process needs similar attention. The school needs a Head who can establish rigorous and efficient hiring practices both to bring in excellent teachers&mdash;in skill and in mindset&mdash; and to establish the needed onboarding and professional development practices to support their transition and growth throughout their hopefully long tenure at the school. Ultimately, the Head should prioritize freeing teachers from organizational and parental distractions, so that teachers can focus on the student experience, and work to grow and develop teachers to be the most effective possible.</p>
<p>Having gained the appropriate knowledge of Tessie&rsquo;s culture and history, the new Head will be able to bring the focus back to creating and systematizing a high-quality, student-centered, academically challenging school that fosters curiosity and love of learning in gifted students of all ages and stages. This will help them ensure mission and programmatic alignment across and within divisions and limit or remove siloes. The Head will then be able to provide clear messaging for role responsibilities while also fostering a universally respectful working culture.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p>""Kids find their people at Tessie!"" Serving gifted students and their families from Pre-K to Grade 12, Tessellations (Tessie) provides an appropriately challenging experiential education that recognizes and nurtures the individual strengths of gifted learners, empowering them to confidently express who they are and pursue a meaningful life. Often when students start at Tessie, it is the first time they feel like they're interacting with intellectual peers. Whether discussing every airplane model that was ever built since the first flight or explaining to another student the concept of infinity, students greet each other's interests with kindness and awe. Tessie teachers foster their students' curiosity and are appropriately attuned to the corresponding sensitivities that some of these learners display. Exploration, openness, and a commitment to meet the developmental needs of all its students is what you'll find at the heart of this new and still developing school.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><br>Born out of the demand of Silicon Valley's families, Tessie opened in 2020 through a collaboration between a group of like-minded families and educators. In just four years, Tessie has grown from serving 30 gifted learners online to almost 300 on a 9.4-acre main campus, as well as an additional local nature campus that provides easy access to the outdoor exploration-a key part of the project-based program. Tessie's promise is to support gifted learners in their education and development so that these young people develop the mindset and skills to contribute to creative and innovative life-changing solutions.<br><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br><!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><strong>Governance and Administration<br><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br><!--[endif]--></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Tessellations currently has a nine-person Board of Directors. To bring a school from an idea to a fully functional PreK-Grade 12 school (currently serving students in 9th grade only) requires the dedication and commitment of each board member, and each board member is incredibly invested in the long-term success of the school. The board is made up of a collaborative group that understands the need to now transition from supporting all of the start-up operations to a group focused on long-term fiscal sustainability and viability. The board is actively expanding to ensure that they have the full range of needed expertise as well as to make sure that they are right-sized for the much bigger school they are today. To note, they have recently added two new board members: one an experienced administrator in a gifted school and the other an experienced independent schoolboard member and fundraiser. In all ways, the board is invested in growing their learning and capacity, including working with an outside governance expert to make sure their work is both appropriate and at the highest level.<br><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br><!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The founding Head of School and Executive Director Grace Stanat was the right individual to build and grow Tessie at the appropriate rate for durable success. The school is now ready for the next stage of leadership. The board has placed an Acting Head of School at the helm as they look for a system-oriented and experienced Head to guide the future of the school.

389,"Academy for Teachers, Executive Director","<p>Search for the Executive Director<br>The Academy for Teachers<br>New York, New York</p>
<p>The Academy for Teachers (or &lsquo;The Academy'), a not-for-profit organization that improves education by cultivating a culture of prestige and intellectual joy for teachers, seeks a visionary and results-oriented leader to serve as its next executive director. The Academy was founded in 2011 to honor and support teachers as respected professionals. Specifically, the Academy provides teachers from public, charter, and private schools in the New York City metro area with professional development of the highest quality; organizes special events and activities that bring public, charter, and private school teachers together in community; and supports new teachers with mentoring and workshops led by experienced veteran teachers who are ""Fellows"" of The Academy. As it approaches its fifteenth anniversary, The Academy is considered the gold standard in professional development in New York City and has built a growing, vibrant community of 3,200 of the city's strongest teachers.</p>
<p>It is often said that teachers have the most important job in the world, but in fact, the profession is dangerously underserved and undervalued. Studies show that the tenure of more than fifty percent of teachers is five years or less, a rate of burnout that results in a staggering national annual cost of $8 billion. The Academy addresses the teacher retention crisis with meaningful results. An impact study published in a peer-reviewed journal found that teachers who participate in The Academy's programs become four times more likely to continue teaching than teachers who don't. The executive director, serving as an ambassador of The Academy to the world at large, will be tasked with increasing awareness of its work.</p>
<p>Partnerships with other organizations are key to The Academy's success. The city's leading universities and cultural institutions partner with The Academy through access to leading experts and artists and by hosting programs in their finest rooms, so that teachers feel dignified the moment they walk in the door. Although 75% of The Academy's Fellows work in public or charter schools, private schools in the Academy's Private Schools and Public Education Partnership make annual contributions to support The Academy's ability to offer programs that bring private, charter, and public school teachers together.</p>
<p>The Academy is well-positioned to grow. It currently has 3,200 ""Fellows"" from 650 public, charter, and private schools in the metro area, but New York City alone has more than 100,000 teachers working in 2,500 schools, which leaves a lot of room for growth. While the executive director should work to deepen The Academy's presence in the city, there are also significant possibilities for regional, national, and online growth. As the organization's leader, it will be important for the executive director to think strategically about managing future growth, overseeing staff, creating new partnerships, and developing new revenue streams.</p>
<p>The Academy for Teachers currently operates within the Greater New York City area. Those who are interested in the position must currently live or be willing to relocate to New York, or be within a reasonable, regularly commutable distance. The anticipated salary for this role is $180,000 annually.</p>

Singapore's identity is built on multiculturalism, and Singaporeans are proud to attract people worldwide. This 'Singapore Spirit' significantly impacts new arrivals who feel welcomed with open arms into their new community, which is a great help with the practicalities of daily living. &nbsp;It's unsurprising that the country is the best destination for expats moving with children.""</p>
<p>Singapore is well known for its safety and cleanliness. &nbsp; Moreover, given its location in the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore is ideal for travel. &nbsp;Residents can easily escape for the weekend to one of the region's many idyllic beaches and islands.</p>

<p>The Opportunity Statement and application instructions are available at DRG Talent at <a href=""https://drgtalent.com/career/head-of-school-the-harley-school/?rpid=1157834&amp;postid=IvdNIfufTKA&amp;webapp=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://drgtalent.com/career/head-of-school-the-harley-school/?rpid=1157834&amp;postid=IvdNIfufTKA&amp;webapp=1</a></p>
<p><strong>The School&nbsp;</strong><br>Vision: We envision a thriving world in which we all become our truest and best selves.</p>
<p>Mission: We are a diverse, inclusive community of learners rooted in empathy, strengthened by challenge and exploration, and emboldened to act with care for each other and the world.</p>
<p>Values: Joy in Learning, Diverse Community, Academic Excellence, Mental and Physical Wellness, Sustainability<br>&nbsp;<br>Diversity Statement: The Harley School believes diversity enriches all groups or communities, and the individuals that are a part of them. Diversity of race, ethnicity, geographical origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, familial or economic status forms the fabric of our society. The Harley School seeks out students, families, and employees who value and contribute to the diversity of our institution and community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Program&nbsp;</strong><br>Harley is a student-centered school, throughout all of its programs. The School focuses on engaging students in their learning process, helping them become active learning agents with the autonomy they need to succeed at the next level. In an era focused on high stakes testing, Harley focuses on depth of learning over the broad general knowledge at the heart of most curricula.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proudly progressive, Harley emphasizes human connection within its educational framework, prioritizing the holistic development of everyone on campus. The School is dedicated to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment by continuously seeking to recognize and understand everyone's lived experiences. This is an ongoing commitment which places listening, celebrating, and empowering students at the forefront, creating space where all community members feel safe to be their authentic selves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Harley, Joy in Learning is more than just a motto. From the earliest grades, Harley's play-based thematic approach sets the stage for hands-on, inquiry-driven learning at all levels. Despite the School's relatively small size, it offers an impressive range of opportunities for its students. These programs include Sustainability Education and the Commons Building (with bee-keeping!), an impressive visual and performance artistic breadth (including glass working), focused and excellent athletic opportunities in conjunction with Allendale-Columbia School, and civic engagement that includes Horizons at Harley, the Briggs Center for Civic Engagement, and the life-changing Hospice Elective. STEAM programming is the focus of many schools these days, as it is at Harley. What might not be as common is the fact that 44% of Harvey alumni since 2007 are working in STEAM-related fields. Harley's reputation for fostering a supportive and enriching environment is lived out by every person who experiences it.</p>
<p>All of these programs are informed by The Center for Mindfulness and Empathy Education, funded by an EE Ford grant. The Center has a mission to:&nbsp;<br>Empower Nursery to Grade 12 teachers, students, staff, and parents with the requisite tools and support necessary to foster a sustained, compassionate presence through the development and nurturing of programs that demand authentic human engagement, stimulating our inborn capacity to compassionately connect to and understand others, embracing their situation as our own.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and the Challenges Ahead&nbsp;</strong><br>In a community-wide survey, the most frequently mentioned strengths of the School were:&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Strong sense of community and belonging -- you are known at Harley<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dedicated and talented faculty and staff, with strong student-teacher relationships&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emphasis on individualized learning and a student-centered approach&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Excellent college preparation and rigorous academic curriculum&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Variety of unique and innovative programs and offerings, including outdoor activities&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, with broad exposure to community members from different backgrounds and engagement with a variety of unique perspectives and identities &nbsp;</p>
<p><br><strong>The same survey identified challenges facing the School: &nbsp;</strong><br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hiring and retaining a strong faculty and staff. There are strong and long-serving faculty and staff throughout the school, but national staffing challenges are impacting Harley as well.&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication about identity and mission: while Harley is a leading independent school in Rochester, there are also strong public school options available. Community members see a unique opportunity for the next Head of School to embrace the Harley mission, reach out to the community, and make Harley's commitments and value proposition clear.&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Financial sustainability: as in all independent schools, work in fund-raising, enrollment, and generating other revenues while examining expenses will be important for Harley's future. Specific attention to middle school enrollment will be needed.&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Community fragmentation: turnover among Harley administrators and a strong sense of divisional and faculty autonomy have resulted in a degree of distance among different groups on campus.&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity, equity, and inclusion: Harley's strong commitment to this work comes with the challenge of moving the community forward while building a stronger and more connected community.&nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harley administrators, faculty, and staff are stretched thin while providing so many opportunities to students and supporting the Harley mission: what steps can be taken to support sustainability at the human level at Harley?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rochester</strong><br>As you research Rochester (Rochester, New York - Wikipedia and Events | Visit Rochester), you will quickly see that the city's quality of life stands out. In fact, US World and News Report recently placed it ninth among US cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking to community members, one hears their enthusiasm about the local farm-to-table movement, outdoor and winter activities, outstanding (and accessible) cultural opportunities, the lack of commuting hassles, a low cost of living, and outstanding healthcare and higher-education resources. You also hear that Rochester has been identified as one of the safest cities in the country when it comes to climate-related disasters: Are we ready to be a climate refuge? - Rochester Beacon.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong><br>The salary range for this position is $225,000 -- $300,000, along with a competitive benefits package.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Apply&nbsp;</strong><br>Harley is looking for candidates attracted by the Harley mission and willing and eager to take on the challenges facing the school, including:</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp;building a strong sense of community and addressing issues of diversity and inclusion<br>- &nbsp; &nbsp;developing a clear curriculum and retaining high-quality faculty<br>- &nbsp; &nbsp;showing strong leadership skills while navigating the changing landscape of education<br>- &nbsp; &nbsp;managing finances and overseeing strong work in enrollment management and fundraising&nbsp;<br>- &nbsp; &nbsp;building and maintaining strong relationships throughout the school &nbsp;</p>
<p>The experiences and skills sought are independent school leadership experience, strong communication skills, the ability to inspire others, a vision for the future of the school, effective fundraising and financial management skills, experience in curriculum development and educational technology, strong interpersonal skills, empathy, open-mindedness, and the ability to work collaboratively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Competencies</strong><br>Using DRG's proprietary Competency Generator, six core competencies most needed for success in the Harley head of school role were identified:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instills Trust &ndash; gaining the confidence and trust of others through honesty, integrity, and authenticity.&nbsp;<br>Communicates Effectively &ndash; developing and sharing multi-mode communications that convey a clear understanding of the unique needs of different audiences.&nbsp;<br>Decision Quality &ndash; making good and timely decisions that keep the School moving forward.&nbsp;<br>Manages Conflict &ndash; handling conflict situations effectively, with a minimum of noise.<br>Ensures Accountability &ndash; holding staff and others accountable to meet commitments.<br>Values Differences &ndash; recognizing the value that different perspectives and cultures bring to the School.&nbsp;</p>
